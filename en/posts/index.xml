Introduction Cyberbullying, defined as aggressive or harmful behaviors occurring via the internet, social media, and mobile devices (Lee et al., 2015), remains prevalent even in emerging adulthood. This developmental stage (ages 18–25) is marked by significant life transitions, identity exploration, and increased social media use, exposing individuals to both positive and negative online interactions (Arnett, 2000). While cyberbullying research primarily focuses on adolescents, young adults, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, remain highly vulnerable (Hinduja &amp;amp; Patchin, 2020).</description></item><item><title>How to Pass CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 in Three Months Without Any Cybersecurity Background</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2025/02/22/scientist-writing-guide/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2025/02/22/scientist-writing-guide/</guid><description>This blog post is a bit late, but I still want to share how I passed the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 exam in just three months last summer, without any prior cybersecurity background.
Key Resources The most important study materials for me were Professor Messer&amp;rsquo;s videos and notes. I bought his notes and practice exams as soon as I started preparing. For the first two months, I was also taking full-time online classes, so I mainly watched Professor Messer&amp;rsquo;s YouTube videos:</description></item><item><title>Read: The Scientist's Guide to Writing</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2025/02/19/scientist-writing-guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2025/02/19/scientist-writing-guide/</guid><description>The Scientist&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Writing The Scientist's Guide to Writing by Stephen B.

Scattered chunks of frost suggest
Whence they came, none could attest.
Each passerby, to ice they&amp;rsquo;re drawn,
Lingers more than just upon
A mere path trodden once at dawn.
Paths crossed just once, now sought again,
Downhill paths, in memory&amp;rsquo;s ken,
It&amp;rsquo;s the past self’s gift, from when.
Branches thrown into the watery part,
—Thump—
No resonance in heart,
A weight light, not enough to chart.</description></item><item><title>Discover Journey: Bufflehead</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/11/15/bufflehead/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/11/15/bufflehead/</guid><description>From Wiki On my way from the Suzzallo Library to the Health Science Library, I passed by the fountain. Today is bright but cold, and the fountain wasn&amp;rsquo;t running. Only waves, blown by the wind, and ripples remained. Wearing my earphones, I was seized by a whim to sit on the stone bench for a while. Several water birds were swimming and diving in the pond made by the fountain.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing Crime in Los Angeles</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/08/14/201_project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2023 00:19:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/08/14/201_project/</guid><description>INFO 201 Project

Getting up in a hurry
Washing up, maybe getting something to eat
Rushing out the door
Because he is a neighbor
I hardly ever see him
But I always hear
In the rush
Entering the door, taking a bath
Turning off the lights, going to bed
Moving with a fast-forward button
In comparison
I&amp;rsquo;m an eighty-seven-year-old man</description></item><item><title>Poetry Night</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/12/poetry-night/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 18:15:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/12/poetry-night/</guid><description>The aroma of coffee
Beer, Wine
An electric lever harp
Accompanied by beating rhyme
The fragrant of poetry
From the alley to the street
Getting up and applauding
The table is used for standing
Duet poetry
Whispering behind one&amp;rsquo;s
Or speaking tacitly
Serious nonsense
A poetry
Is elocution
Is performance
Is stand-up comedy
Is a talking between me and myself on the screen
Is a scolding between you and yourself on the stage</description></item><item><title>Several ways of looking at a thrush</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/01/several-ways-of-looking-at-a-thrush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 19:47:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/01/several-ways-of-looking-at-a-thrush/</guid><description>Several ways of looking at a thrush Prologue The story starts with the photo I took last week. When I saw many birds feeding on the dewy lawn, I walked past the Denny Yard with my camera at around 10 am. The sky was overcast, and the shutter speed couldn&amp;rsquo;t be high. Although I took dozens of shots, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find clear pictures. Of the dozens, I picked out only this one with cropped and added extra clarity.</description></item><item><title>Lines for Winter</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/01/12/lines-for-winter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:09:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/01/12/lines-for-winter/</guid><description>Lines for Winter Is that shadows of mountains
or cloud?
Grains of
headlights
Flashing before my eyes
The long line of snakes
Branches take off their disguise
—Another layer beyond the reality
Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me
Snow in everywhere
Two hundred kilometers away
Or a hundred and twenty miles
In American way
Still not charged
In the time of several chars
Someone standing at the beach head
Or what?
The wind blew up the coat</description></item></channel></rss>
