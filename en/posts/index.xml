Beer, Wine
An electric lever harp
Accompanied by beating rhyme
The fragrant of poetry
From the alley to the street
Getting up and applauding
The table is used for standing
Duet poetry
Whispering behind one&amp;rsquo;s
Or speaking tacitly

or cloud?
Grains of
headlights
Flashing before my eyes
The long line of snakes
Branches take off their disguise
â€”Another layer beyond the reality
Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me
Snow in everywhere
Two hundred kilometers away
Or a hundred and twenty miles
In American way
Still not charged
In the time of several chars
Someone standing at the beach head
Or what?
The wind blew up the coat</description></item></channel></rss>
