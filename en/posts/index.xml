Getting up in a hurry
Washing up, maybe getting something to eat
Rushing out the door
Because he is a neighbor
I hardly ever see him
But I always hear
In the rush
Entering the door, taking a bath
Turning off the lights, going to bed
Moving with a fast-forward button
In comparison
I&amp;rsquo;m an eighty-seven-year-old man</description></item><item><title>Poetry Night</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/12/poetry-night/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 18:15:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/12/poetry-night/</guid><description>The aroma of coffee
Beer, Wine
An electric lever harp
Accompanied by beating rhyme
The fragrant of poetry
From the alley to the street
Getting up and applauding
The table is used for standing
Duet poetry
Whispering behind one&amp;rsquo;s
Or speaking tacitly
Serious nonsense
A poetry
Is elocution
Is performance
Is stand-up comedy
Is a talking between me and myself on the screen
Is a scolding between you and yourself on the stage</description></item><item><title>Several ways of looking at a thrush</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/01/several-ways-of-looking-at-a-thrush/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2023 19:47:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/02/01/several-ways-of-looking-at-a-thrush/</guid><description>Several ways of looking at a thrush Prologue The story starts with the photo I took last week. When I saw many birds feeding on the dewy lawn, I walked past the Denny Yard with my camera at around 10 am. The sky was overcast, and the shutter speed couldn&amp;rsquo;t be high. Although I took dozens of shots, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to find clear pictures. Of the dozens, I picked out only this one with cropped and added extra clarity.</description></item><item><title>Lines for Winter</title><link>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/01/12/lines-for-winter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2023 18:09:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://yuanxil.com/en/2023/01/12/lines-for-winter/</guid><description>Lines for Winter Is that shadows of mountains
or cloud?
Grains of
headlights
Flashing before my eyes
The long line of snakes
Branches take off their disguise
â€”Another layer beyond the reality
Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me
Snow in everywhere
Two hundred kilometers away
Or a hundred and twenty miles
In American way
Still not charged
In the time of several chars
Someone standing at the beach head
Or what?
The wind blew up the coat</description></item></channel></rss>
