### January

1. **总结** 0101 ★★★★★
2. **我的精神家园** 0103 ★★★★☆ *幽默且超前*
3. **死在午后** 0111 ★★★★★ *阳光下的沙场，我几乎要爱上斗牛了...*
4. **Crying in H Mart** 0114 ★★★★☆ *The opening was good, but it turned into her memoir. Anyway, it's touching.*
5. **瘟疫之夜** 0116 ★★★★☆ *很难说这本书的内容是否过于冗长，因为它给我的阅读体验还算不错。我注意到了它表达的新意，以及想要囊括的内容，但是它并没有真正撑起来。*
6. **Invisible Women** 0117 ★★★★★ *It is said that women are not suitable for SOMETHING. But SOMETHING is not considered for women at all. With tons of data, this book is readable and worth reading.*
