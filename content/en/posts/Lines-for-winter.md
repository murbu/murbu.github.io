# Lines for Winter

Is that shadows of mountains<br>
or cloud?<br /><br />

Grains of<br>
headlights<br>
Flashing before my eyes<br>
The long line of snakes

Branches take off their disguise<br>
â€”Another layer  beyond the reality<br>
Don't tell me<br /><br />


Snow in everywhere<br>
Two hundred kilometers away<br>
Or a hundred and twenty miles<br>
In American way<br /><br />


Still not charged<br>
In the time of several chars<br /><br />


Someone standing  at the beach head<br>
Or what?<br /><br />


The wind blew up the coat<br>
and hair<br>
Panicked and dodged<br>
From the wind<br /><br />


In the dream<br>
Only a white crane<br /><br />
