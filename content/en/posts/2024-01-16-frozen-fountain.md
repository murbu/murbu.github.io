Inscribed in ice, the fountain's rest,<br>
Scattered chunks of frost suggest<br>
Whence they came, none could attest.<br />
<br />

Each passerby, to ice they're drawn,<br>
Lingers more than just upon<br>
A mere path trodden once at dawn.<br />
<br />

Paths crossed just once, now sought again,<br>
Downhill paths, in memory's ken,<br>
It's the past self’s gift, from when.<br />
<br />

Branches thrown into the watery part,<br>
—Thump—<br>
No resonance in heart,<br>
A weight light, not enough to chart.<br />
<br />

Does this road lead to journey's end?<br>
Yet upon it, I've already wend.<br />
<br />

'Tis but ice, so thin, so slight,<br>
Where life<br>
	hangs but by a thread, mid-flight.
<br />
<br />
