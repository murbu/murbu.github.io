The aroma of coffee<br>
Beer, Wine<br>
An electric lever harp<br>
Accompanied by beating rhyme<br /><br />

The fragrant of poetry<br>
From the alley to the street<br>
Getting up and applauding<br>
The table is used for standing<br /><br />

Duet poetry<br>
Whispering behind one's<br>
Or speaking tacitly<br>
Serious nonsense<br /><br />

A poetry<br>
Is elocution<br>
Is performance<br>
Is stand-up comedy<br>
Is a talking between me and myself on the screen<br>
Is a scolding between you and yourself on the stage<br>
Is a dreamy mutter<br>
Is a ghostly whisper<br /><br />

Poetry night<br>
I hold a hot cocoa<br>
Roam in alcohol<br>
A pupil<br>
Iâ€™m again a poetry pupil<br /><br />
