# A man in a hurry

My neighbor is a man in a hurry<br>
Getting up in a hurry<br>
Washing up, maybe getting something to eat<br>
Rushing out the door<br>
Because he is a neighbor<br>
I hardly ever see him<br>
But I always hear<br>
In the rush<br>
Entering the door, taking a bath<br>
Turning off the lights, going to bed<br>
Moving with a fast-forward button<br>
In comparison<br>
I'm an eighty-seven-year-old man<br>
This is my neighbor.<br>
He's a man in a hurry.
